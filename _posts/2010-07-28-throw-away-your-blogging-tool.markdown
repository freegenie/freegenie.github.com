I love simple ideas like this. Sometimes we all should have the courage to take a few steps back from the crowd, and rethink the way people is trying to solve problems. And then go on exploring other paths. 

[Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) is the software running this website. Which is made up of static HTML pages. So It's probably wrong to say that jekyll runs this website, since all it does is to parse folders and config files to generate html pages. 

It's not all that easy to setup, given that there's plain website setup in the jekyll script. Anyway you can clone an existing repo and make your changes, like I did with "this one":http://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com. 

## Does it really have to be database driven? 

No. As long as you feel confortable with txt files and you don't need much functionality. After all publishing content is still the most important thing in authoring a blog, and the simpler it is, the better. Ultra tagged, categorized, searchable posts are not the key-point when a XXIst century search engine already indexed your website. 

## What do I gain?

- Performance first. There's no app to be spawned all you need is a webserver.
- Easy versioning with your favourite SCM.
