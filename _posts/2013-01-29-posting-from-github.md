description: Trying out to post from inside github

If this one works, I'll really have no excuses to blog more frequently than I used to. I'm adding a file from inside github, on the web, without the need to access my local repo and push. Very handy. The new Zen Mode feature is very cool.

If this one works, I expect my blog posts to have much less formatting, because editing on the local Jekyll instance running you have the chance to review your changes immediately, while working directly inside github this may become a cumbersome process due to the amount of page reloads.

But I also expect to become more and more expert at Markdown-formatting-on-the-flight, so let's see what happens. 

For now I'm enjoying the writing of this new post.
