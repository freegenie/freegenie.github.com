Mozilla site is the worse site in the world where to look for old firefox versions. It's almost 
impossible to find the link to this: 

[ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/](ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/)

The main reason you want to rollback is because of firefox-self-updated-and-you-selenium-tests-got-broken.
