I stumbled upon a new feature in Firfox 15. It allows you to input a string in the 
address bar and find an open tab matching that string. 

1. CMD + L to activate address bar
2. type something
3. press tab a couple of times

This will prepare to find the given string in matching open tabs. 
Cool when you have tons of tabs and you have to go, say, to Asana. 

I still feel Firefox to be a tiny bit heavy so I keep using it just for development, while I prefer to use Safari for everything else.  and for such purpose I use 
a combination of Alfredapp + an Apple script to find in tabs. 

But it's nice to see Firefox moving in the right direction with such little awesome features.
