I took part at RailsGirlsRome 2013 last week as a coach. [You can find here a blog post
of the
event](http://blog.railsgirls.com/post/46670107950/first-italian-rails-girls-event-held-in-rome).
It was a stunning experience, it took me two days to recorver, but I **highly
recommend everybody** to try something similar at least once in their life.
Teaching is an enriching exercise for the soul and very recommendable to test
your communication skills. Do you it once, you'll love it or hate it. I
already love it.
